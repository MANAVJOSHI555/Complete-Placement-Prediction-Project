# 🎯 Placement Prediction Model

A machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a student will be placed based on their academic and skillset data. Built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Flask**.

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to assist students and placement cells in identifying key features that influence placement outcomes. By analyzing historical data, the model predicts if a student is likely to get placed.

## 🚀 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset  
- Trained classification model for placement prediction  
- Interactive web UI built with Flask  
- Real-time predictions based on user input  
- Evaluation metrics included (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

## 🧠 Machine Learning

- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression / Random Forest / [Your Model Name]  
- **Accuracy**: XX%  
- **Libraries**:  
  - scikit-learn  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)

## 🗃️ Dataset
